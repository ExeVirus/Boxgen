# Boxgen

#WARNING: undocumented besides code, tutotirals incoming soon.

## A Lua-based auto-matic collision-box generator

* Accepts water-tight obj files (you can make any mesh watertight)
* You specify the accuracy and minimum size of boxes generated
* Automatically breaks obj files larger than 3 in any axis direction into multiple nodes
* Outputs information in a friendly minetest format for use with an extended register function for such entities. I.e. a register_node() replacement

## To-Be-Completed

5. Provide Tutorial Text
6. Release mod using this toolset 
7. Provide Tutorial Video
8. Provide Tutorial on Using Meshlab to make a simplified watertight mesh for making decent approximations.
